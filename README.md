# do_sorting
It provides an visualisation of sorting alogorithm . This will work as :
1. User will first enter the list of elements , and will further provide the algorithm based on which sorting will be done.
2. Based on the option opted by the user , following elements will be sorted.

This will also provide visualtisation of the working of algorithm, this will help user to understand working of the particular algorithm . For visualisation we will use libraries, random,matplotlib pyplot,animation . random module in order to generate a random array of numbers to be sorted. The matplotlib pyplot and animation modules will be used to animate the sorting algorithm. 


#Algorithm to be covered:

Quick Sort	
Bubble Sort	
Selection Sort	
Insertion Sort		
Merge Sort
